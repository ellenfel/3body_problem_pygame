# Pygame Gravity Simulation

This project simulates gravitational interactions between bodies using Pygame. It allows users to observe phenomena such as the three-body problem and other gravitational dynamics.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-gravity-simulation.git
   cd pygame-gravity-simulation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

```
python src/main.py
```

## Features

- Simulates gravitational interactions between multiple bodies.
- Visual representation of the motion of bodies under gravitational influence.
- Ability to add and remove bodies dynamically during the simulation.
